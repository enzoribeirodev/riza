<!-- image -->

- Use the device in a place without magnetic interference for the device to operate normally.
- Your device contains magnets. Keep it away from credit cards, implanted medical devices, and other devices that may be affected by magnets. In the case of medical devices, keep your device more than 15 cm apart. Stop using your device if you suspect any interference with your medical device and consult your physician or your medical device manufacturer. The location of the magnets is marked in grey in the device image.
- If you have a medical implant in your heart, do not place your device in a pocket close to your implanted device, such as your chest or inner jacket pocket.
- Keep a safe distance between your device and objects that are affected by magnets. Objects such as credit cards, passbooks, access cards, boarding passes, or parking passes may be damaged or disabled by the magnets in the device.
- Do not fold the device toward the backside. The device will be damaged.

<!-- image -->

- Fold the device before putting it in a bag or storing it. Be sure not to store the device unfolded as there is a chance that another object could scratch or puncture the screen or cause screen damage.
- Do not press the screen or the front camera lens with a hard or sharp object, such as a pen or fingernail. Doing so may result in damage to device, such as scratches, dents, or screen damage.
- Do not apply excessive pressure to the area where the screen folds. Doing so may result in screen damage.
- Do not unfold the device by pushing the screen apart with your finger or other objects. Doing so may result in damage to the device, such as scratches or punctures on the screen.
- The protector film attached to the main screen is a film that was designed exclusively for foldable devices. For the protection of the screen, it is recommended that you do not remove the film. If you remove the protector film, the screen may be damaged.
- Do not apply other films or stickers not approved by Samsung. Doing so may result in screen damage.
- Be careful as the coating of the screen protector film may peel off when performing repetitive touch actions, such as swiping on the screen.
- When folding the device, do not place any objects, such as cards, coins, or keys, in between the screens, as doing so may cause damage.
- Exposure to small particles, such as sand, may cause damage to the device, such as scratches or dents on the screen.
- When using the speakers, such as when playing media files or using speakerphone, do not place the device close to your ears.
- Be careful not to expose the camera lens to a strong light source, such as direct sunlight or a laser. If the camera lens is exposed to a strong light source, such as direct sunlight, the camera image sensor may be damaged. A damaged image sensor is irreparable and will cause dots or spots in pictures.
- Do not use the device if any parts are broken or damaged, such as glass or acrylic body, as this may result in injury. Use only after it has been repaired by a Samsung Service Centre or an authorised service centre.

- If dust or foreign materials enter the microphone, speaker, or receiver, or if these parts are covered, the device's sound may become quiet or certain features may not work. If you attempt to remove the dust or foreign materials with a sharp object, the device may be damaged and its appearance may be affected.
- Be careful not to drop the device on the floor as it could damage the screen and result in black bruise-like spots or colourful dots on the screen. It could also damage the area where the screen folds by causing internal cracking.
- You may notice a crease at the centre of the main screen. This is a normal characteristic of the device.
- Connectivity problems and battery drain may occur in the following situations:
- -If you attach metallic stickers on the antenna area of the device
- -If you attach a device cover made with metallic material to the device
- -If you cover the device's antenna area with your hands or other objects while using certain features, such as calls or the mobile data connection
- If the device is folded and covered by part of your body, such as your hands, radio waves may be interfered with, resulting in Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other networks not having smooth connections.
- If the air vent hole is covered by an accessory, such as a protective film or sticker, unwanted noises may occur during calls or media playback. (SM-F766B)
- If the air vent hole or the area around the rear camera and the Side button is covered by an accessory, such as a protective film or sticker, unwanted noises may occur during calls or media playback. (SM-F761B)
- Do not cover the proximity/light sensor area with accessories, such as stickers or a cover. Doing so may cause the sensor to malfunction.
- The light may flicker at the top of the device during calls because of proximity sensor operation.

## Battery charging tips and precautions

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Use only Samsung-approved battery specifically designed for your device. Incompatible batteries can cause serious injuries or damage to your device.
- Use of Samsung-approved chargers and cables specifically designed for your device is recommended. Use of incompatible chargers or cables may result in injury or damage to the device.
- Connecting the charger improperly may cause serious damage to the device. Any damage caused by misuse is not covered by the warranty.
- Use of the USB Type-C cable supplied with the device is recommended. Using a Micro USB cable may cause damage to the device.
- If you charge the device while the multipurpose jack is wet, the device may be damaged. Thoroughly dry the multipurpose jack before charging the device.

## Getting started

<!-- image -->

- To save energy, unplug the charger when not in use. The charger does not have a power switch, so you must unplug the charger from the electric socket when not in use to avoid wasting power. The charger should remain close to the electric socket and easily accessible while charging.
- Use of a charger approved by Samsung that guarantees charging performance is recommended.
- If the battery is completely discharged, the device cannot be turned on immediately when the charger is connected. Allow a depleted battery to charge for a few minutes before turning on the device.
- If you use multiple apps at once, network apps, or apps that need a connection to another device, the battery will drain quickly. To avoid losing power during a data transfer, always use these apps after fully charging the battery.
- Using a power source other than the charger, such as a computer, may result in a slower charging speed because of a lower electric current.
- The device can be used while it is charging, but it may take longer to fully charge the battery.
- If the device receives an unstable power supply while charging, the screen may not function. If this happens, unplug the charger from the device.
- While charging, the device and the charger may heat up. This is normal and should not affect the device's lifespan or performance. If the battery gets hotter than usual, the charger may stop charging.
- If the device is not charging properly, take the device and the charger to a Samsung Service Centre or an authorised service centre.
